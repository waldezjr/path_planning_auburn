# path_planning_auburn
This was a final project in a mobile robotics course I took as an undergrad in Auburn University.

The code is provided as is. It was originally developed in windows 7 as a codeblocks project using opencv C/C++.

It is quite naive, as it uses simple K-means and potential fileds implementations, but it might be useful to someone else, if you use it on your research I would be very glad to hear from you :)
